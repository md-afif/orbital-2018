# **Milestone 1 (04/06/18)**

Proposed level of achievement : Gemini

Targeted audience: Youths, millennials, young adults

### **Project scope**

We propose to create a web-app that collates the most popular and recent TV shows over the past years, making it easier for avid TV show viewers to find a show to watch and keep up with the trend. 

### **Motivation**

TV shows are gaining in popularity and are a common pastime for many youths and millennials - some may even go as far as to claim it to be a hobby. In this day and age, these shows are almost never viewed on the television anymore, but on streaming platforms instead. Examples of such platforms are Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and many more. The existence of the many different streaming platforms give viewers a plethora of choices to view the various shows from, but it then becomes difficult to keep track of the different shows when watching across platforms as each platform would have their respective selection of shows.
Our web-app aims to provide viewers with a single platform where viewers can decide what to watch, without having to cross-reference with too many different websites. At the same time, viewers can also keep up with the shows that are currently in-trend and popular amongst other youths and young adults. 

### **User Stories**

- As an avid tv-show viewer, I want to be able to look for a tv show without having to cross-reference across various platforms.
- As a youth/young adult, I want to be able to keep up with the current trendy shows without having to put in too much time and effort. 
- As an administrator, I want to be able to update the web-app to include new shows and categories for viewers to consider watching.
- As an administrator, I want to be able to maintain the accounts of users of the web-app to ensure optimum usage of the web-app.

### **Core features**

Basic features (CRUD)
- Users can sign up for an account and log in using that account on the home page (Create)
- Users can select which category they want to watch via a drop-down menu, choose which show they want to watch, and choose whether they agree to watch the show or not - allows navigation between pages (Read) 
- Users can add reviews and ratings of shows watched (Create/Update)  
- Admins can edit the list of shows and categories - add new shows, remove old shows, add new categories (Create/Delete/Update)

### **Advanced features and extensions**

- Social media integration (Facebook/Twitter/Gmail/Wechat etc.)
- Sharing reviews, recommending shows to friends on social media
- Embedding video trailer of each show
- Download episode list for the show for the convenience of the user to follow with the show 
- Bookmarking of shows (save for later feature) and saving which shows have already been watched so that the web-app will not recommend them again 

### **Proposed additional features**

If time permits, we intend to include a machine learning algorithm to better cater to our user’s needs. Using supervised learning methods, the machine learning algorithm will better match our user with a recommended tv show from our database.
As the number of users of our web-app increase, there would be more data available to improve the algorithm. The recommendations of shows for new users will be based on ratings and feedbacks by existing users, hence making the web-app better suited for the users’ needs.

### **Proposed languages and frameworks**

- HTML5,CSS3,JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- DJango(Python) 
- MySQL 

### **Proposed timeline**

- 21 June - 4 June: Work on Milestone 1, read up and familiarise ourselves with the proposed languages and frameworks (through YouTube videos, online courses e.g. Codecademy, Udemy, Coursera)
- 5 June  - 6 June: Data mining of various TV shows from platforms such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, MetaCritic 
- 7 June - 10 June: Building database of TV shows and user accounts template using MySQL
- 11 June - 15 June: Frontend work, coming up with design and template of the website
- 16 June - 20 June: Backend work, linking up frontend with backend and database
- 21 June - 25 June: Launch of first prototype of web-app, testing and debugging 
- 26 June - 2 July: Work on milestone 2, continue to perform iterative user testing and debugging




# **Milestone 2 (02/07/2018)**

### **Core features developed**

As stated in Milestone 1, we planned to implement essential features by Milestone 2 for our minimum viable product, and possibly even one or two of the advanced features. Below is a list of the features we have implemented followed by a short description: 

1) Users can sign up for an account and log in using that account on the home page (Create)

	- We decided to include this feature on every page of the web-app, instead of the home page only. The login and sign up buttons are on the navigation bar of every page. Clicking on the signup button would bring the user to a simple sign up page where the user can sign up for an account by picking a username and password. Clicking on the login button would bring the user to a login page, where the user can sign in to his/her account. 
	- Here, we made use of Django’s authentication packages. For sign-ups, this ensures no repeated usernames and that strong passwords are chosen. For logging in, this ensures that the correct password is used for the specified username.  

2) Users can select which category they want to watch via a drop-down menu, choose which show they want to watch, and choose whether they agree to watch the show or not (Read) 
	
	- The initial plan was to adopt a minimalistic design for the web-app, hence the idea of a drop-down menu. However, we decided to go with grids of the different categories as we feel it would be more aesthetically pleasing and intuitive for the user. 

	- We also chose to have the list of shows pop up on the same page, instead of redirecting to another page. Clicking on the title would bring the user to the show’s details page, and clicking on an area outside the popup would close it. Again, we feel that it is more aesthetically pleasing and intuitive for the user as they would not have to navigate between too many different pages. 

	- The “watch” button on the synopsis page would give a popup, with where to watch the shows. Clicking “another show” will immediately redirect the user to another show of the same genre. 

3) Users can add reviews and ratings of shows watched (Create/Update)  

	- Each show’s details page would have a navigation panel on the left, where users can navigate between the show’s synopsis and reviews. The reviews page would show all the reviews for the show left by other users, or “No reviews yet!” if there are no reviews yet. Below the reviews would be a form for the user to leave a review and rating. Upon submitting the review, it would automatically be reflected above. 

4) Admins can edit the list of shows and categories (Create/Delete/Update)

	- This feature was implemented through MySQL by building of the databases and linking them up with the front-end through Django’s jinja templating. 

5) Embedding video trailer of each show

	- Video trailers were taken mostly from YouTube and occasionally from IMDb. Trailers were embedded using the HTML iframe tag.


### **Problems encountered**

The initial problem we encountered was juggling with the different languages and frameworks. Each had their own syntaxes and style, hence made it difficult to switch between them. This got better after familiarising ourselves with them.  


Subsequently, the main problem we encountered was that we made the mistake of starting with front end development, followed by back end development. Due to the rigidity of the Django framework, we should have started with the back end while incorporating the front end along the way. This made it difficult to keep with the timeline we had set back in Milestone 1.
Django makes sure that everything works “the Django way”, hence made it somewhat challenging to link the entire front end with the back end, especially when the front end work was already almost completed while the back end work just started.

For example, when doing the front end work using HTML, CSS and JavaScript locally, the changes made were immediate and easily viewed just by refreshing the page. However, with Django, the use of templates and static files made it difficult to see the changes. This resulted in us using different styles of writing CSS and JavaScript (inline and internal, instead of solely external), making the code messy. 


### **Features yet to be implemented**
- Social media integration (Facebook/Google+ etc.)
- Sharing reviews, recommending shows to friends on social media
- Download episode list for the show for the convenience of the user to follow the show 
- Bookmarking of shows (save for later feature) and saving which shows have already been watched so that the web-app will not recommend them again 
- Machine learning


### **Moving forward**
We aim to enhance the features we have implemented. Below is a list of our aims for the existing features:  

1. Log in and Sign up pages
2. User to provide more details when signing up, e.g. name, email address etc
3. Profile page for users 
4. Show recommendations popup
5. Adding shows for reality category (currently shows thriller shows)
6. Refine CSS for the popup, adding stars as ratings etc 
7. Show’s details and reviews page 
8. Refine CSS for both pages
9. Empty fields after submitting a review
10. Automate name field based on username, a timestamp for each review, allow for  editing of existing reviews


# **Milestone 3 (30/07/2018)**

### **Extensions implemented**

Our web app is built on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and the Python Django framework. After milestone 2, our aim was to implement extensions to our web app to enhance its functionality and usability. Below is a list of the extensions implemented, followed by a description:

**1. Social media integration (using Facebook and Google+)**

Users can now login using their existing Facebook/Google+ accounts instead of being forced to sign up for a user account specific to our web app. Many of the features are reliant on the user being logged in, hence it is crucial for logging in and signing up to be seamless and efficient. 

We understand that users can fall into two categories - short term and long term. While we do not force users to sign up/log in, having an account would greatly increase the features available to them. Hence, social media integration would make this more efficient.

**2. Sharing of shows to Facebook**

If logged in via Facebook, users can share the shows that interest them with their friends. If the user is not logged in, he/she would be requested to first login via Facebook, before they can start sharing the shows. 

The “share” button is included in the details page of the show below the navigation bar. The show’s title, a short summary and the image of the show would be shared to the user’s Facebook timeline if they choose to. On Facebook, clicking on the post would lead the user’s Facebook friends to our web app.

**3. Profile page for users**

Logged in users would be able to view their own profile page, which features a list of the reviews they have left, shows they have bookmarked and a “change password” feature.

**4. Bookmarking of shows**

Logged in users can also bookmark shows they like for easier access in the future. It functions as a “save for later” feature, or for users to save shows that they really like. Bookmarks will be featured in the profile page of the user and there are two ways for users to bookmark shows. 

Firstly, a bookmark button is featured on the list of shows popping up in the main page, on the right hand side. After bookmarking a show, the bookmark button will turn green, and clicking the button again would remove the bookmark. Secondly, a bookmark button is also featured in the details page of each show, just beside the Facebook sharing button. It functions the same way as the first way, except that the button would turn blue instead after bookmarking.

**5. Machine learning using k-means clustering**

Although users won’t be able to outrightly use this feature, our web app’s machine learning function comes into play when recommending shows to users. When finally deciding whether to watch a show or not, clicking on the “Other recommended shows” button would feature a list of recommended shows (provided the user is logged in). The shows are recommended using k-means clustering based on ratings of previous shows left through reviews. 

For example, User A and an unknown number of other users left similar ratings on the same shows. The model will identify them as having ‘similar’ tastes and they will all be clustered in the same cluster. Shows that the other users have watched, which User A has not watched, will be recommended to User A. This applies to all users in the same cluster. 

As of now, as we are in no danger of scalability issues, we have set the model to recluster users with every 3 reviews left on our webapp and/or every time a new user is created. Also, number of clusters used will increase as the number of users increase, specifically number of clusters, k = (number of users /10) + 2.

There are however, a few limitations to this model.
We are assuming that users that have left similar ratings on a particular show will have similar tastes (in TV shows).
If a user has more than one review on the same show, only one review will be used.

### **Problems encountered and bugs squashed**

Integrating social media and our web app was a challenge for us, even more so on our deployed website compared to local deployment. This is due to the confusing URL redirects that each social media credentials require that works differently on our local website and on our deployed website.

In addition, with regards to the Facebook sharing feature, the Facebook scraper still uses the old tags. As such, we have to manually scrape the shows (by visiting every single show) to update the tags, which added on to the work we had to do.

Furthermore, after integrating social media to our web app, some users feedbacked that it was not functioning, while others had no problems with it. We found out that the problem lied in website security, and that features involving social media would not work due to “website not secure” and “invalid certificate” problems. 

After looking into it, we found out that adding “https://” was crucial for the said features to work. However, as we are hosting on the heroku platform, we did not have a work-around for the “https://” to be automatically generated into the URL without incurring monetary costs. Hence, users have to type it in the first time they are accessing the web app. 

Finally, designing forms ( e.g. review form) proved to be a problem when using django forms. Django forms are styled in their own way, and have limited designs. Although it was not a major problem, it proved to be a tedious and recurring one. 


### **User testing**

Iterative usability testing was carried out amongst people that fit the demographic (youths, millennials and young adults). Our web app was continuously and iteratively tested before the launch amongst a group of 5 users.
